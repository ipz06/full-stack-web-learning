# Mondrian Painting Project

## Description
The Mondrian Painting project is a fun and educational exercise where I recreate a Mondrian-style painting using CSS Grid.
The project helps demonstrate the power of CSS Grid for layout creation, and it's part of a Fullstack Development course 
where I am learning to work with CSS Grid for creating complex, responsive designs.

In this project, the goal is to construct a geometric design inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian using just HTML and CSS. 
It involves using the CSS Grid system to create and position colored blocks, mimicking Mondrian's iconic abstract paintings.

## Technologies Used
### HTML: Structure of the painting and layout.
### CSS: Styling, specifically CSS Grid to create the layout and design of the Mondrian painting.
### CSS Grid: Used to divide the painting into sections and control the positioning of elements
